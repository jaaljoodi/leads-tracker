Lead Tracker README
Jaber Aljoodi

Overview

This is a lead tracker web application that I created following Scrimba course. In this project, I learned how to use various JavaScript concepts such as addEventListener(), input.value, function parameters, template strings, localStorage, and JSON objects.

Features

The lead tracker allows users to input leads by providing a URL link manually or save a specific web page by clicking on the 'Save Tab' button. Once you've done that, the application stores it in localStorage as a JSON object. The application also displays all the stored leads in a table format, which allows users to easily view and manage their leads.

How to Use

To use the lead tracker, simply fill out the input fields for the lead's or click on the save tab button once you visit a specific page. The application will then store the lead in localStorage. 

To delete a lead, double-click the "Delete" button next to the lead you wish to remove. The application will then remove the lead from localStorage and the table.

Technologies Used

This lead tracker web application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Specifically, I utilized the addEventListener() method to add event listeners to the input fields and buttons. I also used input.value to retrieve the values of the input fields, and function parameters to pass data to functions. Additionally, I used template strings to display data in a more readable format, and localStorage to store leads as JSON objects.


Conclusion

Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me. I gained a deeper understanding of various JavaScript concepts, including localStorage and JSON objects.
